19 April 1924  #SunderlandAFC now have both #htafc and #ccfc just a point behind them at the top of Division One, and have played more games than either. At the bottom #pnefc move up two places, while #cfc cut the gap to a safe place to two points but have only two games left. https://t.co/AINnIRC0ZP
