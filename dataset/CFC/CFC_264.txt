Caicedo is among my top 3 favorite #CFC players. His ceiling is world class but these stats offer little context. Of course Caicedo has more tackles. Arsenal always has the ball. Of course Rice has lost possession more Arsenal always has the ball. More ground duels because CFC defend more. Caicedo has had a good season but Rice has been better.
