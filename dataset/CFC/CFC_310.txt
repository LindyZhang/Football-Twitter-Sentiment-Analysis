Manchester City will assess Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne tomorrow ahead of Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with #CFC.   Ô∏è Pep Guardiola: "Erling felt something, a muscular issue. Kevin seems well, but felt exhausted, so tired, after five months injured [earlier this season]. That's normal. We'll see more tomorrow."
