Tomorrow we face best teams in the world.  The girls in Spain should go there and give it all it will be a tough challenge but hopes we scrap a win    Our men at Wembley should just know that they are two wins away from a trophy and possibly Europe.   FIGHT TILL END. #CFC #CFCW https://t.co/yyY7Dm4iFb
