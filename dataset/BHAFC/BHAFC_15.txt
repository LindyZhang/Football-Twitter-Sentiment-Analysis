19 April 1924  In Division Three South, #pompey return to the top on goal average with a game in hand on #MillwallFC. The #Swans are just two points back, but defeat for #bhafc means they are running out of games to catch up. A point for #qpr lifts them above #afcb at the bottom. https://t.co/NArWijyEyi
