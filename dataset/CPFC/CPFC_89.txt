#CPFC #WHUFC   Hughes, Richards and Ward face fitness tests. 'We have three question marks,' said Oliver Glasner. 'Chris: it was the first time he trained with us today, but it was a very easy session. Then we have Joel, who also had issues this week with his groin, so we will see tomorrow. Will got a knock yesterday in training, so he couldn t train today. So it is three players we will take the final decision on tomorrow. That is it; nobody else is coming back.'  https://t.co/9L4lFJifn2
