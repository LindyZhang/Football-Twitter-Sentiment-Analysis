 Ô∏è Glasner  I don't want to talk too much about the Liverpool game because it's over. It's one week ago and it was a great win, but it doesn't help us winning against West Ham.   Of course, maybe regarding confidence, but what we have to do on the pitch is very important.   #CPFC https://t.co/cf5lvJjQc6
