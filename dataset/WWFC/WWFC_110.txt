@MrRyanLeister @Wolves It s no laughing matter, GON has written the game off with two more winnable games coming up. Arsenal is priced as a category A game but we are getting the reserves. It stinks and is unacceptable IMO. Big games under the lights against the top teams is what it s all about #wwfc
