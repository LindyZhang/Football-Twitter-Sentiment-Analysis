#wwfc | Squad situation: opinion   It feels like Wolves have been trying to wing it with a tiny squad for years, but now it s finally caught up with them.  Yes they ve had some bad luck in one particular area, but the depth across the squad is not that of an established Premier League team.  The custodians should be very grateful to Gary & his team of coaches for getting Wolves to a position of safety with six games left, because imagine being in a dogfight when the squad is being exposed like it is.  I also feel that Wolves unanticipated league position in January played its part in the decision not to bring anyone in, because if they were in danger I think we d have seen a different window.  Others have mentioned it, but imagine if Wolves were going to Wembley this weekend in this situation? I dread to think, bang average United or not.   How many genuine nines do Wolves have? How many out and out wide players/wingers? Add in a concerning lack of ample depth at wingback & in the goalkeeper department, put all of that together and it raises serious questions about squad management over the past few seasons.  Having a small squad not only hinders your season by limiting options, it also puts more pressure on the remaining fit players who may be in or around the red zone which potentially puts even more players at risk.   Football is getting more and more demanding as a sport & if the squad situation isn t addressed it will eventually cost Wolves their Premier League status.   Fosun have done some great things since they ve been at Molineux, but the care of squad depth & lack of options is an area where standards have dropped in recent times.
