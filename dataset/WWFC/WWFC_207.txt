There is an expectation that #Wolves will make an official offer for Las Palmas goalkeeper √Ålvaro Valles.  The 26 year old is set to leave the Spanish club this summer and #WWFC have already enquired about the goalkeeper. It's reported that Nottingham Forest had a  20m bid rejected for Valles in January.    @marca
