#COYH #BrentfordFC   Rob Edwards reveals Teden Mengi is the only player who might have a chance of returning on Saturday. "We have had progress this week, whether that means there can be progress on to the pitch now [I'm not sure]. I don t anticipate too many changes, but we are making progress. There will be some players coming back but it will be a struggle for this weekend."  Issa Kabore is in contention after missing the game against his parent club.  https://t.co/9L4lFJifn2
