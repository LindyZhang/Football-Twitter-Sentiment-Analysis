My ideal lineup for tomorrow, presuming Toney isn't 100%.  Not worth rushing Ajer and Norgaard back, especially with how good Vita has been as a 6.  Hopefully Kevin and Ethan are fully fit otherwise it will be Zanka and Neal.  Kevin as a Winger and Wis as a striker  #BrentfordFC https://t.co/K1e4mqoX71
