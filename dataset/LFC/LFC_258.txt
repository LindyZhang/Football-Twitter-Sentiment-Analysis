@AFCMikey @DeadlineDayLive I mean: when you guys got Declan Rice, I thought, wow! the Gooners should def wrap up the PL this season. Don t get me wrong, you re still in it for sure. tbh, I m surprised #lfc are where they are with rebuild. I d rather #afc win it than city 100%. But u need a striker   ‍ ️
