Wednesday 7th August 2002: my first trip to Villa Park to watch an #AVFC first team game, a 0-2 second-leg defeat to Lille in the UEFA Intertoto Cup (I was 8 years old).  Just the small matter of a 22-year wait, but this month I finally got to see us avenge that defeat!   #UTV https://t.co/hJIBiqDd6s
