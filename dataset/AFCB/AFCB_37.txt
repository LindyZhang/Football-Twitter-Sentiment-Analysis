#AFCB #AVFC   The Colombian may not play again this season. 'It s a strain, so it s going to be really tight, I don t know if he will be recovered to play the last game, but it s going to be difficult because the normal time is three or four weeks.'  Iraola is 'more optimistic' that Marcus Tavernier can still play a part during the run-in. 'The injury was [one week] before; it gives you some more chance, but definitely, he s not going to be involved this week. We will try to play with him, but it also has to be the final games of the season.'  Elsewhere, 'some are getting closer', but they won't be ready for Sunday.
