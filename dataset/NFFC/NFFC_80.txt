@nffcalways1 @RobinOfLoxley1 @ForestFanF13794 @NFFC @Morgangibbs27 Murillo was always brought cheaply with a view to a big profit. That's why I expect him to go this summer for a vast profit. Good business and one of our top pieces of business since promotion to the PL. I'm an optimist, but realize we have to balance the books every year. #NFFC
