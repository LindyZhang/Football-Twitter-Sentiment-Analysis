Thought Reyna made a decent impression for #NFFC against Wolves, but at the same time we really missed Elanga's willingness to stay wide. We only really threatened down our left hand side.  Look at MGW, CHO & Elanga v Fulham, their positioning is much more widely spread. Switch Reyna in for Elanga against Wolves, and it's all left focussed.  Hopefully Elanga is available for an impact off the bench which might actually be a bigger positive for Forest considering Everton's injury issues and ages at the back.
