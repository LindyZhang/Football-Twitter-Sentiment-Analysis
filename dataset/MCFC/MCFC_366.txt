I'm a Madrid fan, but away goals rule shouldn't been done away with. The match ends 4-4,with Man City scoring 3 goals at Santiago Bernabeu. For me it just feels unfair that a team scores 3 away goals &amp; concedes only 1 at home. What's the advantage?  #UCL #RMFC #MCFC #Football  Ô∏è https://t.co/5J5Q0tXyax
