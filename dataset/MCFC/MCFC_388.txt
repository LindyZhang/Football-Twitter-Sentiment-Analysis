@SkyFootball @SkySportsPL Following today's news that the Premier League have scrapped FA Cup replays, I have lost all sympathy for the English clubs who lost last night.  They don't care about football or fans, they're only driven by greed. Good riddance!  #FACup #ARSBAY #ManchesterCityRealMadrid #MCFC
