I do not personally believe we need to change the manager but if Graham Potter does turn up at @ManUtd are we moving to a 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1 ?  Sancho still likely to depart ? Bremer and Jarrad to sign up ? What about fullbacks? Can we afford a premier league level striker?  #MUFC https://t.co/1JBMmbdP0U
