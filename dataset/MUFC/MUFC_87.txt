Happy 46th Birthday to former #MUFC left back, Gabriel Heinze. The Argentinian joined us from PSG in 2004, &amp; won a EPL title. He played 83 times, scoring 4. A quality player, yet injury prone, he lost his place. In '07 he demanded a move to LFScum, so SAF sold him to Real Madrid. https://t.co/Jp3nAbCR4C
