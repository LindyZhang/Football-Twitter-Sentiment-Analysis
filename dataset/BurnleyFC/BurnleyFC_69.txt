  Having now checked back, 303 (v Brighton on Saturday) is indeed the highest aggregate of starting XI shirt numbers for any competitive Burnley match!  I've also added a note on my match summaries (for all matches since 1999/00) to show this value  #BURBHA #BurnleyFC #Clarets https://t.co/vnYA1xHJ5n
