  Back in August 2021, Burnley lined up with all players wearing shirts 1 to 11 (although, annoyingly, Admin didn't list them in numerical order!)  For this weekend's match there were no Burnley players at all with shirts 1 to 11 in the starting XI  #BURBHA #BurnleyFC #Clarets https://t.co/fVfuAUsVbV
