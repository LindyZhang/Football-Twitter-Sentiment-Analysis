12 April 1924  It was a good day for #ccfc in Division One as they beat #BurnleyFC 2-0, while leaders #SunderlandAFC crashed 2-0 at #afc and #htafc were held 1-1 by #mcfc. A 3-1 loss at #brfc surely ends #bwfc's challenge, while #cfc are in real trouble after losing 2-1 at #nufc. https://t.co/02SiYm6kIg
