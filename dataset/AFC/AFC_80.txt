Bit of reading for the train home. I grew up in the invincible era, but Mesut has a certain hold on me. He s one of my favourite Arsenal players. Maybe first, with Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ramsey, Rosick√Ω and Cazorla getting an honourable mention   #arsenal #arsenalfans #afc #gunners #gooners #coyg #northlondonforever
