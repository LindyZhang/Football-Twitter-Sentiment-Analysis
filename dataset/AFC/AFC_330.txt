#Arsenal can go top with a win at Wolves. It's a monumental task to win the league but the players have to go out with a focus to win the next six games. If there is fatigue, Arteta has to trust his squad players and utilise their talents, rather than the same tired legs. #AFC https://t.co/NboBOf0Y0p
