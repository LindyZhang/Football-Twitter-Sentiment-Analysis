#LFC #FFC   Trent Alexander-Arnold will be checked after making his first start in over two months on Thursday night. 'If Trent had been a bit fitter, we could have gone a bit longer, but it is insane that he has even played! In the end, he was running out of gas.'  With Conor Bradley sidelined for around three weeks, Joe Gomez is an option at right-back if Trent is not risked from the start at Craven Cottage.
