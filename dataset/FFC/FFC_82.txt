#LFC #FFC   Focus now will switch to the league after Liverpool won in Bergamo but lost the Europa League tie 3-1 on aggregate to Atalanta. 'It was clear we gave ourselves a massive hurdle,' Klopp said post-match. 'I liked the game a lot tonight with the desire and power... it was incredible from them. Tonight, we won, so we are back to winning ways. We have a few days to recover to go again against Fulham. That will be a different game, but it will be tricky.'
