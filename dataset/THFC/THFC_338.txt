I've got a question to the local THFC fans. Im going to the Spurs' game for the first time in my life in May. I would like to know what to visit and how to spend the time in London before the match (against City) and whether you've got some tips for a newbie. Thanks! #COYS #THFC https://t.co/bZBg86ukPT
