WEST HAM | David Moyes will assess Nayef Aguerd who came off at half-time last night.  Jarrod Bowen was "touch and go" for the Leverkusen game and had an injection to play. He needs to be assessed.  Areola and Phillips need to be "checked" but have trained.  #FPL | #WHUFC  Ô∏è https://t.co/ydsBVBp1Dc
