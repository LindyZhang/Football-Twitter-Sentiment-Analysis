#WHUFC | #UEL | #WHUB04 | #MoyesBall | #guff  1 - 1  (Agg. 1 - 3)  Magnificent first half but Leverkusen the better side in the second half, helped by a truly terrible referee.  The players gave their all.  A little more clinical and it could have been our night.  Our lack of depth on the bench meant we had no real options when badly needed.  The European journey is over for now.
