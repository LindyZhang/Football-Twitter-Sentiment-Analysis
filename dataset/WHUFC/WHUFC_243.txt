#WHULEV  ️ FT 1-1 (agg 1-3) @EuropaLeague  Hammers played a blinder in the 1st half &amp; for 90 mins kept a 1-0 lead. It was never enough but all credit to our players for a superb gutsy performance. The ref was awful: an overly fussy, mincing, pouting disaster #COYI #WHUFC  ️ https://t.co/262xAzTFVr
