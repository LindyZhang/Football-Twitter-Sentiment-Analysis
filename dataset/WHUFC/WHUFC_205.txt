When you come up against the best and most in form team in Europe across 2 legs you need all the luck in the world falling your way.  I am so proud of West Ham, absolutely gave it their all in true West Ham fashion. Just weren't good enough in the end. But bloody proud!  #WHUFC https://t.co/Xv1hZQM9Yk
