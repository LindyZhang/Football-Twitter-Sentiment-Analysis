Proud of the performance the lads put in last night. Gave their all and showed their determination to fight for the badge.  Chances were missed and the officials ruined the game, but continue playing like this and we stand a chance of another top 7 finish.    Ô∏è #WHUFC #COYI https://t.co/pScygKrB7u
