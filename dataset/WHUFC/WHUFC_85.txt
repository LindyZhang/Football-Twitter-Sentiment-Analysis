#WHUFC #CPFC   Jarrod Bowen started and assisted against Leverkusen, but once again, the forward will be checked ahead of kick-off following his recent back injury. "I've not seen him yet today. Jarrod was really touch and go going into last night's game, and it took an injection for him to play. We'll have to see how he is ahead of Sunday. You always want your big players to be available. If we have them all, we always have a good chance of getting a result."  https://t.co/9L4lFJifn2
