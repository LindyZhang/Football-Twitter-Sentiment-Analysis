West Ham now has to play Kurt Zouma (two knees gone) and Uncle Ang (somewhere in his 60s) as centre-halfs and a group of kids on the bench, but is leading the unbeaten and already crowned German champions and the greatest limbs in Europa are back.   What a club.  #WHUBAY #whufc https://t.co/ZQ1rhy6fmB
