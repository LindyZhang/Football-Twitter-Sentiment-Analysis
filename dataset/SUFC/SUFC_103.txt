 Ô∏è Better news from Chris Wilder. #SUFC   "Re-introduction, back on the grass today (Thursday), Daniel Jebbison, which is good news. Rhian Brewster has been training: returned to training - returned to competitive action, and obviously finished that cycle as well. So, Rhian is out of the physio room and he's having pitch-based stuff, and so is Jebbison."
